                <!--- Write a summary about yourself -->
                I am a Pembroke Welsh Corgi that is seeking a 
                career that fits my professional skills, personality, and cute tendencies. 
                My long ears can detect threats from afar and my short (but strong) legs allow me to run like the wind. 
                I can bring joy to your working environment, provided that you give me an air-conditioned room
                with lots of food.
